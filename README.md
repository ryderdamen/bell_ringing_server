# Bell Ringing Server
This is a server I built to collect statistics from various apps and determine if a bell should ring or not.

## Some Notes
- I've used globals here because I don't want to set up a redis instance, and this app only runs 1 instance of itself
- This repository has some functions missing from app.py - if you want to know why, send me a message
- This repository also has an arduino component
